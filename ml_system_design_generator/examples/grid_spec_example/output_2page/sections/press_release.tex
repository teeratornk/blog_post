\subsection{Utility Launches Feeder-Level Extreme-Weather Outage Risk Nowcasting}

\emph{Real-time probabilistic forecasting enables smarter crew staging, wildfire/PSPS decisions, and restoration sequencing---reducing storm outage duration.}

\bigskip

\textbf{The Problem.}\quad
Storm coordinators rely on coarse regional forecasts and experience to stage crews and trigger Public Safety Power Shutoffs. Without feeder-level precision, utilities over-deploy in low-risk areas while under-resourcing the hardest-hit corridors.

\medskip

\textbf{The Solution.}\quad
The system fuses high-resolution weather inputs, asset condition scores, and vegetation-proximity data with SCADA/OMS/DMS telemetry to produce feeder-level calibrated outage probabilities refreshed every 15~minutes---degrading gracefully when telemetry is delayed. Supported events: hurricane, wildfire (including PSPS mode), and severe convective storms.

\caption{Key Benefits and Expected Impact}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lX@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Expected Impact} \\
\midrule
Storm SAIDI reduction   & 10--20\,\% during major events \\
Crew pre-positioning    & Staging aligned to top-risk feeders \\
Wildfire/PSPS precision & Narrower shutoff zones, fewer customers affected \\
Shift-handover quality  & Objective risk snapshots replace verbal summaries \\

``This gives operators a trusted decision-support layer---not a black box. They see calibrated probabilities, overlay judgment, and act earlier with confidence.''
