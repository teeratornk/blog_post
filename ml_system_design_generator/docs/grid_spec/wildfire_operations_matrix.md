## Time Horizons Overview

| Time Horizon | Cadence | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Seasonal Readiness & Risk Profiling** | Months to weeks before core wildfire season | Utility teams in planning offices, control centers, and some field locations review prior-year wildfire performance, high fire-threat district maps, vegetation conditions, and community exposure. They update wildfire mitigation plans, PSPS criteria, and capital/maintenance portfolios (hardening, vegetation, non-wires), and coordinate expectations with fire agencies and key stakeholders. |
| **Pre-Event Forecasting & Simulation** | Several days to hours before forecast Red Flag / high fire-weather events | Operations and planning staff monitor fire danger indices, weather (wind, humidity, lightning), and fuel conditions using internal tools and external feeds. They run simulations of faults, potential ignitions, PSPS footprints, and power-flow constraints to identify circuits, communities, and critical facilities likely to be affected, and prepare preliminary PSPS and mitigation options. |
| **PSPS / Pre-Event Mitigation & Mobilization** | Hours before/during high-risk fire-weather window | Control rooms, field staging areas, and EOCs become active as PSPS decisions are finalized, protection settings are adjusted, and crews are mobilized. Utilities coordinate closely with local emergency managers and fire agencies, communicate potential shutoffs to customers, and position patrol and repair resources while ensuring crew safety plans and access routes are in place. |
| **Active Fire & Real-Time Response** | During active wildfire(s), typically first 24–72 hours of major events (and longer for multi-day fires) | Emergency Operations Centers, control centers, and field teams operate under access restrictions, smoke, and rapidly changing conditions as fires evolve. Utilities keep some circuits de-energized to prevent ignitions, support incident command with asset status, and adjust system operations (including coordination with CAISO/TSO) while prioritizing safety, critical infrastructure, and situational awareness. |
| **Restoration, Recovery & Improvement** | Days to months after fire/weather conditions subside | Patrol and repair crews perform damage assessments and rebuild or repair assets, while operations teams manage staged re-energization based on "all clear" determinations and inspection results. Planners and program managers analyze ignition causes, near misses, and PSPS performance to update wildfire mitigation plans, asset and vegetation strategies, DER/microgrid programs, and digital tools for the next cycle, closing the loop into the next seasonal readiness phase. |

## Key Structural Observations

1. **Wildfire-specific lifecycle**: Unlike the general grid operations matrix, this matrix follows a wildfire event lifecycle — from seasonal preparation through active fire response to post-event recovery — rather than daily operational time horizons.

2. **PSPS (Public Safety Power Shutoff) as central mechanism**: PSPS decisions thread through virtually every persona's responsibilities, representing the primary proactive risk mitigation tool for wildfire prevention in the grid context.

3. **EOC activation model**: The matrix reflects an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) activation paradigm, where normal operational hierarchies shift to incident command structures during active fire events.

4. **CAISO/TSO coordination**: Multiple personas reference coordination with CAISO (California Independent System Operator) and TSO entities, indicating this framework is designed for California-style utility wildfire operations but applicable broadly.

5. **DER/Microgrid integration**: The inclusion of a dedicated DER/Microgrids persona reflects the growing role of distributed energy resources as both wildfire resilience assets (islanding capability) and complicating factors (additional coordination requirements during PSPS events).

6. **Vegetation management as frontline defense**: Field Operations/Vegetation is positioned as a critical pre-event and recovery persona, highlighting that physical infrastructure maintenance in fire-prone corridors is a first-order wildfire risk reduction strategy.

7. **Cyber-physical security**: The IT/OT & Cybersecurity persona recognizes that wildfire events create elevated cyber risk windows, particularly around SCADA/OMS/DMS systems that are critical during PSPS switching operations.

8. **Closed-loop improvement**: The "Restoration, Recovery & Improvement" column consistently references feeding lessons learned back into seasonal readiness — establishing a continuous improvement cycle across all personas.
