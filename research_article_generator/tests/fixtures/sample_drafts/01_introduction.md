# Introduction

Computational mechanics has seen tremendous advances in recent years, driven by
the development of novel numerical methods and increasing computational power
\cite{hughes2000finite, zienkiewicz2005finite}.

This paper presents a new approach to solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The key contributions
are:

1. A novel architecture for improved convergence
2. Theoretical analysis of approximation properties
3. Numerical experiments demonstrating superior accuracy

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related
work. Section 3 presents the methodology. Section 4 shows numerical results.
Section 5 concludes with future directions.
